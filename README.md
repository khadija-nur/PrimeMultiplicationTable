## Introduction

- This is an application that takes numeric input (N) from a user and outputs a multiplication table of
  (N) prime numbers.

### How to run it.

Clone this repository and install dependencies by running the following commands in your terminal

```javascript=
git clone https://github.com/khadija-nur/PrimeNumbersTable
npm i
```

To run tests , run `npm run test` in your terminal

### What I'm pleased with.

- I have used a TDD approach to plan ahead which has effectively helped me in reducing bugs and producing high quality code.
- I created a front end and styled it to demonstrate my backend as clearly and visually appealing as possible
- I have written clean and modular code, with most functions in a `helpers` folder for a more easily maintainable, simple and extensible solution

### What I would do with it if I had more time.

- I would create end to end testing for my front end and use codecov to track my code coverage report
- I would look into using a less complex solution for more effeciency
